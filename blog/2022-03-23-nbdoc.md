# Create Testable, Reproduceable Docs and Blogs With Notebooks

> Never copy and paste code into documentation again!

<a id="markdown-background" name="background"></a>

## Background

This repo provides an example of how to create blog posts and/or documentation with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) using Jupyter Notebooks.  When you create documentation with notebooks:

- Your **documentation is fully testable** with unit tests
- **No more copy / pasting code** into your blog posts and docs
- **The output of code is always up to date**, since it is generated by actually running  code, rather than copying and pasting it from somewhere else.
- You can **author technical posts and docs in a WYSIWYG manner**, which allows you to iterate faster.
- You can still write markdown posts if you want to.

Blog posts support [Docusaurus Markdown features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features), such as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).


## To get started [go here](/docs/nb).

The rest of these blog posts are reference blog posts from the Docusarus documentation.
